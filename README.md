# C-PROJECT-SEM-1
I have uploaded my project for end semester of C Programming for 1st semester
A simple, menu-driven Bank Account Management System built using the C programming language.
This project demonstrates fundamental concepts such as structures, file handling, conditional statements, loops, and modular programming.

It allows the user to:

>> Create a new bank account
>> Deposit money
>> Withdraw money
>> Check the current account balance
>> Store all account data permanently using binary file handling
